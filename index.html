		<h2>Feel free to peruse, this is a work in progress</h2>

		Sina Booeshaghi is a junior at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology studying Mechanical Engineering and Math. He is co-president of MIT-ASME, Corporate Relations director of TechX, and Chair of Education, yet still finds time to challenge himself academically. Currently, he is spearheading a major campus-wide movement to improve grade transparency at MIT in order to better help manage student stress. A true Floridian at heart, Sina will often be found casually sipping tea next to a space heater in an attempt to brave the Cambridge Winters. He lives at and is a member of the Kappa Sigma Fraternity.<P>
